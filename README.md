# Predicting_NBA_Outcomes

“I think it’s pretty important that you learn how to keep your own scoreboard and how to be focused on what truly matters over the long term.”

## Topic
Predicting NBA Player & Team Performance

## Purpose 
We are using data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) in order to predict player performance and the impact on match outcomes. We want to understand the predictive power of certain features and whether or not these inputs can be used to accurately predict player performance and match outcomes.

## Resources

### Data Sources: 

### Technology
Software: Anaconda 4.9.2, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 , Python 3.7.6, SQLalchemy
Using: Pandas, NumPy, SQLalchemy extensions and functions
Algorithms:  

## Source Data Description
Data will be sourced for players and their respective teams.  Types of data utilized will be as follows:
- Biometrics: height, weight, wingspan, etc; 
- Performance: offense (3 pt %, FG %, FGA, etc)& defense (rebounds, steals, blocks, etc); 
- Teams: home, visitor, win streak, jersey type, etc.
- Data will be sourced via API (NBA.com or other source) and web scraping.

## Research Questions
- What features are important to determine player performance? 
- How will players perform across key performance indicators (points, assists, steals, blocks, rebounds)?
- Does the sum of individual player performance determine game outcomes?
- Are there other “team” or “biometric” factors that determine game outcomes?
- How will aggregate player performance inform team outcome (win vs. loss)?
